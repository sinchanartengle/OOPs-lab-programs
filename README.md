# OOPs-lab-programs

This repository contains Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) lab programs implemented in C++  
These programs cover fundamental OOPs concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, operator overloading, data structures, and more.

2. Student.cpp – Handling student details  
3. Complex.cpp – Operator overloading (`+`) for complex numbers  
4. Date.cpp – Working with date class  
5. Matrix.cpp – Matrix operations using classes  
6. Stack.cpp – Stack implementation using class and arrays  
7. Queue.cpp – Queue implementation  
8. Quicksort.cpp – Sorting using quicksort algorithm
